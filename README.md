# RunningFredClient
A client version of Running Fred Lite by Dedalord.

This is not my proudest release as it only a few hours to conjure up, but seeing as the current world record holder uses this build; I've decided to make this open source.

If you wish to have Flash re-enabled on your system for the client and other flash players to properly function, you can install the Newgrounds player - which will automatically modify the flash mms.cfg file on your system to fix flash games. It can be found here, and uninstalled after if you please: https://www.newgrounds.com/flash/player

Happy running.
